    "(a) (i) Identify the differences between a graph and a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most important difference between a graph and a tree is their complexity level. The complexity of a tree is lower than of a graph due to its connected (there is exactly one path from any node to any other node in the tree)ยน and acyclic (does not contain a path that starts from a node and ends at the same node) nature. Graphs on the other hand can have cycles, making them more complex. Having cycles on a graph can lead to multiple paths between nodes, resulting in an increase of complexity.\n",
    "    Another difference between both is their root nodes. Trees have a single node called root node which is used as the starting node of a tree. Meanwhile, graphs can have multiple roots or none.\n",
    "    Due to the ordered/hierarchical nature of a tree, they are used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as the file system of a computer. Graphs due to their unordered and more complex nature are used to represent equally unordered and more complex relationships such as of those present in a social network.\n",
