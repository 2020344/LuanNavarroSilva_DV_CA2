    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A puzzle has multiple ways of reaching the end solution. Fig. 1 shows a graph that represents all possible\n",
    "routes to the solution. The starting point of the game is represented by A, the solution is represented by S.\n",
    "The other points in the graph are possible intermediary stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) (i) Identify the differences between a graph and a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The most important difference between a graph and a tree is their complexity level. The complexity of a tree is lower than of a graph due to its connected (there is exactly one path from any node to any other node in the tree)¹ and acyclic (does not contain a path that starts from a node and ends at the same node) nature. Graphs on the other hand can have cycles, making them more complex. Having cycles on a graph can lead to multiple paths between nodes, resulting in an increase of complexity.\n",
    "        Another difference between both is their root nodes. Trees have a single node called root node which is used as the starting node of a tree. Meanwhile, graphs can have multiple roots or none.\n",
    "        Due to the ordered/hierarchical nature of a tree, they are used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as the file system of a computer. Graphs due to their unordered and more complex nature are used to represent equally unordered and more complex relationships such as of those present in a social network.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(ii) Explain in detail how the graph is an abstraction of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The graph is an abstraction of the problem as it is a visual representation of the problem. The graph shows possible routes that can be taken from the starting point A to the solution S. Each node (represented by letters) represents a different stage in the problem. The lines (or paths) that connect each node represent actions from one stage of the problem to another. The numbers beside each path represent the cost or effort required to move between each stage of the problem.\n",
    "        The graph shows multiple routes from the starting point to the solution. Due to these multiple routes, the problem can be solved in multiple ways. The only difference between each solution is their directness and, some paths take longer or may cost more to reach the solution than others.\n",
    "        While there are many paths to reach the solution S from the node A, some will be more optimized than others. Usually, the ones preferred as a solution for a graph problem are the most optimized ones due to their reduced cost/effort to reach the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Identify the advantages of using a visualization such as the one shown in Fig. 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Visualizing a problem using a visualization such as the one shown can make it easier for the human brain to understand and deal with a problem. The human eye instinctively captures patterns within the graphs, complex networks visualized as graphs are naturally easier to comprehend than data sorted in the form of spreadsheets or reports.²\n",
    "        Having a visualization of a problem also means a more effective communication, as all participants can share their ideas and insights using the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Demonstrate how Dijkstra's algorithm would find the shortest path to the solution in Fig.1 through diagrams and written explanation of each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \tUsing Dijkstra's algorithm we would create a list of all unvisited nodes. It will contain all nodes available in the graph: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V and W (21 in total). In that list, we would set the distance to start node A to 0 since this is the starting point, and all other nodes to infinity.\n",
    "    \tStarting with A we would inspect its unvisited neighbor nodes, we would calculate the distance to each neighbor by summing the distance from the node we would be at (in this case A) and the weight of the edge connecting to the node we are aiming to go to. For example, the distance of A is 0 as it is the starting point, to reach B it would cost 0 (initial distance) + 1 = 1. The distance to go to node B would be 1 from node A.\n",
    "    \tAfter inspecting all neighbors of the starting node (A), we would mark it as checked. Meaning that it won't be rechecked since we explored all of its neighbors. We would then select the next node based on the smallest distance from the starting node. In this scenario, it is B with a distance of 1 from A. We would do the same process as we did with A, exploring all neighbors of B and filtering the list of visited nodes based on the smallest value possible. For example, from B to C it will cost the distance to B + the distance to C (1+2 = 3) which is shorter than the distance from A to C which is 5. We would update the list to show C with the best route to come from B as it costs less than to come to node C from A.\n",
    "    \tThe process would repeat itself until all paths are explored and the list is complete. From then, it is tracked back from S which path is the shortest. For this graph the shortest path from S is 17 from node A passing through N, which to get to N costs 10 from node A coming from L, which in its turn costs 7 to get from node A coming from G, which costs 4 to get from A coming through C, and as we did earlier to get to C it costs 3 from A going through B and lastly costing 1 to reach B from A. So doing it backward, the best route to get to S is S < N < L < G < C < B < A or simply A > B > C > G > L > N > S costing 17 overall.\n",
